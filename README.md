# NEVER MAKE THIS PUBLIC

I have my API keys uploaded so for the love of god may it remain private

## HTBreacher

An AI agent that reads my writeups website (or anything I configure) and gets the text out of it. Then it builds the Knowledge Base and then uses that to make the AI work.

## Setup

Create the venv and install all dependencies

If you don't have ollama install it and then do `ollama pull openhermes`

After that run this thing so that it.... you know, runs

Also have an ollama api key so that you can use the cloud (which this does btw)

## GUI

To get the GUI see this [link](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui)
Run the GUI after the CLI is done compiling

## Usage of CLI

To update the kb run scraper.py
Then run the normal app.py
